We are the coveted alumni of GCECT and, through our \"GCECT Alumni Association\", we strive to connect to the world a community of technologists, business leaders, and academicians, primarily with the background of Ceramic Science, Glass and Refractories, Computer Science, and Information Technology. We celebrate our legacy for decades; we take pride in our extraordinary bond among seniors, juniors, and students; and we cherish our industry network that we created by bridging the generations.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><strong>About the Institute:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">The Government College of Engineering & Ceramic Technology, GCECT (formerly known as the College of Ceramic Technology), was established in the year 1941 in Kolkata, India, as the Bengal Ceramic Institute, by the distinguished Professor Sasadhar Ray. In the year 1962, a B. Sc. (Tech.) Degree Course in Ceramic Technology was introduced under the affiliation of the University of Calcutta, followed by a B. Tech. Degree under the West Bengal University of Technology(presently Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal) (affiliated to A.I.C.T.E., New Delhi). For many years, the Institute belonged to one of the rare technology disciplines that groomed graduates in Ceramic Technology for the ceramic and materials science fraternity in India. With time, the institute has seen the addition of two new B.Tech courses, namely, Information Technology and Computer Science & Engineering, in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively. The Institute also offers M. Tech. Degrees in Ceramic Technology and Information Technology. Recently, the institute received an \"A\" grade certification from the National Accreditation Assessment Council (NAAC).<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><strong>About GCECT Alumni:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">Over the last eight decades, the institute has been a bridge connecting academicians and industrialists with cutting-edge technological prowess as the fulcrum. The GCECT Alumni Association, with its renewed embodiment since 2015, has been committed to developing networking between the present and future alumni on a common platform on a continuing basis and becoming the voice of the alumni in all matters related to the entire GCECT community. In a quick time, since inception, we have grown to over 550 strong life members and are building on this base passionately. As we advance our unique legacy, we continue to build stronger connections, organize talks and conferences, invest in welfare, sports events, and professional networking, and serve as shining examples of the kind of people that their institution produces. We strive to maintain the honour and dignity of our fellow alumni as well as maintain camaraderie and fraternity amongst the ex-students of the Institute by promoting social and cultural association amongst themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">With approximately 150 students graduating each year, we represent a diverse alumni network ranging from graduate trainees to industry stalwarts and entrepreneurs. Be it in fields of Ceramics, Refractories, Glass, Iron & Steel, Cement and Engineering or in the new-age technologies of Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and plethora of their unleashed potential, our alumni shine on with impeccable achievements and prestigious track records!

We are the coveted alumni of GCECT and, through our \"GCECT Alumni Association\", we strive to connect to the world a community of technologists, business leaders, and academicians, primarily with the background of Ceramic Science, Glass and Refractories, Computer Science, and Information Technology. We celebrate our legacy for decades; we take pride in our extraordinary bond among seniors, juniors, and students; and we cherish our industry network that we created by bridging the generations.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><strong>About the Institute:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">The Government College of Engineering & Ceramic Technology, GCECT (formerly known as the College of Ceramic Technology), was established in the year 1941 in Kolkata, India, as the Bengal Ceramic Institute, by the distinguished Professor Sasadhar Ray. In the year 1962, a B. Sc. (Tech.) Degree Course in Ceramic Technology was introduced under the affiliation of the University of Calcutta, followed by a B. Tech. Degree under the West Bengal University of Technology(presently Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal) (affiliated to A.I.C.T.E., New Delhi). For many years, the Institute belonged to one of the rare technology disciplines that groomed graduates in Ceramic Technology for the ceramic and materials science fraternity in India. With time, the institute has seen the addition of two new B.Tech courses, namely, Information Technology and Computer Science & Engineering, in the years 2000 and 2001 respectively. The Institute also offers M. Tech. Degrees in Ceramic Technology and Information Technology. Recently, the institute received an \"A\" grade certification from the National Accreditation Assessment Council (NAAC).<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><strong>About GCECT Alumni:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">Over the last eight decades, the institute has been a bridge connecting academicians and industrialists with cutting-edge technological prowess as the fulcrum. The GCECT Alumni Association, with its renewed embodiment since 2015, has been committed to developing networking between the present and future alumni on a common platform on a continuing basis and becoming the voice of the alumni in all matters related to the entire GCECT community. In a quick time, since inception, we have grown to over 550 strong life members and are building on this base passionately. As we advance our unique legacy, we continue to build stronger connections, organize talks and conferences, invest in welfare, sports events, and professional networking, and serve as shining examples of the kind of people that their institution produces. We strive to maintain the honour and dignity of our fellow alumni as well as maintain camaraderie and fraternity amongst the ex-students of the Institute by promoting social and cultural association amongst themselves.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">With approximately 150 students graduating each year, we represent a diverse alumni network ranging from graduate trainees to industry stalwarts and entrepreneurs. Be it in fields of Ceramics, Refractories, Glass, Iron & Steel, Cement and Engineering or in the new-age technologies of Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and plethora of their unleashed potential, our alumni shine on with impeccable achievements and prestigious track records! Industries like, Saint Gobain, Tata Steel, Vesuvius, RHI Magnesita, TRL Krosaki, Kajaria, Cera, Parryware, Almatis, Imerys, Microsoft, Google, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant,TCS, Accenture, HCL, Capgemini etc, are, to name a few from the unending list of corporate we have set our benchmarks upon. From all the corners of our country to the Middle East, South East Asia, Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Australia, we are continuously working to develop, strengthen, and illuminate the legacy of the Institute\u2019s alumni family by networking across all horizons under one umbrella. Through grand industrial symposia every year, both in person and digitally, we are upgrading our reach across the geographical boundaries and heralding how the alumni of this Institute can contribute to the betterment of science and technology, society, sustainability, and humanity.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><strong>About your bond with us<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">Once a graduate from the Institute, you are heartily welcome to become a member of the GCECT Alumni Association, providing extraordinary access both to a dynamic alumni network and to lifelong learning support, thereby deepening the bond with our alma mater and the GCECT alumni family.<\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\"><em>With one step, you can help us forge a bold new chapter in GCECT Alumni\u2019s extraordinary story.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p class=\"inherit-font-size\">And, to our industry partners, corporates, and our community circle, your constant allegiance and fostering of the GCECT alumni in various forums has created this exceptional foundation.
